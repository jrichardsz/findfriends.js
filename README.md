# Find Friends Javascript/Node

## A POC node web service that uses the find my friends api to locate friends using gmaps.

This requires two items - use charles or fiddler to dump this from your phone via proxy.

- a prsID
- the fmfAuthToken (can be found via proxy from any fmf requests).

It may take a few attempts via the 'Locate' button to retrieve data. It will also update periodically.
